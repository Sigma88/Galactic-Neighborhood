I'll write here random stuff that I think could be usefull.

1- I will add to each star a comment into the Properties{} node with the luminosity value of the IRL version of the star this way you have something in mind when designing the curves

2- To change the bright effect of the star you can tweak this node:

Kopernicus
{
	Body
	{
		ScaledVersion
		{
			SolarLightColor
			{
				sunAU = 13599840256  // this seems to be a modifier for distance
				{
					key = -0.01573471 0.217353 1.706627 1.706627 		// I don't really know how this curve is calculated
					key = 5.084181 3.997075 -0.001802375 -0.001802375	// but from my trial and error it seems that
					key = 38.56295 1.82142 0.0001713 0.0001713		// the first number is for distance and the second is for the dimension of the bright effect
				}								// the higher the first number is, the closest you are to the star.
			}									// so basically in this example, -0.015 is at infinite distance
		}										// while 38 is very close to the star (you can edit the curve with KittopiaTech)
	}											// these values are the standard ones, from the Stock Sun
}
